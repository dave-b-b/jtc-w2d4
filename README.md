Summary
In this hands-on exercise, you'll set up a Flask web server, implement basic routes showcasing your diverse interests, and integrate JavaScript for a more interactive user experience.

 

Objectives
Configure Flask Web Server:
   - Install Python and Flask on your computer.

   - Initialize a Flask project.

   - Set up the necessary configurations for a Flask web server.

Hands-On Exercise: Expressing Your Interests through Routes with JS Integration
   - Create routes within the Flask application, each representing a unique aspect of your hobbies and interests.

   - Implement logic in these routes to provide information or details about each interest.

   - Integrate JavaScript to enhance the user experience on specific routes.

 

Instructions
Setup Environment:
   - Install Python and Flask on your development environment if not already installed.

Configure Flask Web Server:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.

   - Run the following commands:

     ```

     pip install Flask

     flask init

     ```

 

Expressing Your Interests through Routes with JS Integration:
   - In your Flask project, create routes in the main application file (e.g., `app.py`).

   - Create HTML templates for each route in the `templates` folder.

   - Implement JavaScript functionality in the `static/js` folder to enhance interactivity. For example, you can use it to dynamically update content or handle user interactions.

   - Update your routes to render these templates and include the necessary JS files.

   Example:

   ```python

   from flask import Flask, render_template

 

   app = Flask(__name__)

 

   @app.route('/')

   def home():

       return render_template('base.html')

 

   @app.route('/gardening')

   def gardening_info():

       return render_template('gardening.html')

 

   @app.route('/cooking')

   def cooking_details():

       return render_template('cooking.html')

 

   @app.route('/sci-fi')

   def sci_fi_world():

       return render_template('sci_fi.html')

 

   if __name__ == '__main__':

       app.run(debug=True)

   ```
